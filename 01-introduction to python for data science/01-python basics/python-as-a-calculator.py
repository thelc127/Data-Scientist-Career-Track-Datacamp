# Suppose you have $100, which you can invest with a 10% return each year.
# After one year, it's dollars, and after two years it's 100*1.1 = 110.
# Add code to calculate how much money you end up with after 7 years, and print the result.
# Addition, subtraction
print(5 + 5)
print(5 - 5)

# Multiplication, division, modulo, and exponentiation
print(3 * 5)
print(10 / 2)
print(18 % 7)
print(4 ** 2)

# How much is your $100 worth after 7 years?
print(100 * 1.1**7)
