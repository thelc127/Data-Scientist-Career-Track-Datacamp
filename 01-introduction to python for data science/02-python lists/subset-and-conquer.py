# Print out the second element from the areas list (it has the value 11.25).
# Subset and print out the last element of areas, being 9.50. Using a negative index makes sense here!
# Select the number representing the area of the living room (20.0) and print it out.
# Create the areas list
areas = ["hallway", 11.25, "kitchen", 18.0, "living room", 20.0, "bedroom", 10.75, "bathroom", 9.50]

# Print out second element from areas
print(areas[1])

# Print out last element from areas
print(areas[-1])

# Print out the area of the living room
print(areas[5])
