# Import titanic.csv using the function np.recfromcsv() and assign it to the variable, d. You'll only need to pass file ' \
# 'to it because it has the defaults delimiter=',' and names=True in addition to dtype=None!
# Run the remaining code to print the first three entries of the resulting array d.
# Assign the filename: file
file = 'titanic.csv'

# Import file using np.recfromcsv: d
d = np.recfromcsv(file, delimiter= ',', names= True, dtype= None)


# Print out first three entries of d
print(d[:3])
